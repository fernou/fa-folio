              I'm passionate about GIS and data, it gives me a deep understanding of what is going on around me. 
              Natrually I am a curious person and often times have more questions than answers. It was a blessing to have stumbled upon this field of innovation when I joined the United States Army in 2011.
              During this time I was fortunate to have been mentored by some of the best and brightest mentors in the Army. This led to my motivation and inspiration in pursing a carrer in GIS.
            </p>
            <p class="about-wrapper__info-text">
             I graduated with a Bachelor's of Science in Geography at Marshall University in December 2020, and I am currently pursing my graduate degree at the University of Oklahoma in Geospatial Technologies.
              Since leaving the Army I have held postions as a pavment technician with Bucknam Infrastucture, a GIS Technician with the County of San Bernardino, and currently holding a postion of GIS Analyst with the City of Palm Springs.

                When I started my position with City of Palm Springs, the City of was sharing 2 Arcmap licenses among 5 staff memebers. 
                My first initial task was to assess and address GIS needs of each department. The outcome of this assesment was to implement ESRI's ArcGIS Enterprise. 
                This implementation would allow the City to intergrate seamlessly with assest managment, permit, and CAD (9-1-1) software applications. Future uses include deploying an Open-data platform for the public.

               During my graduate program at OU, one of my final projects for a course involved analyzing suitable areas for a grocery store. 
                What made this project so special is that the area of interest was the same community of whom I serve.The citizens of the Desert Highland community have voiced their concern
                that there needs to be an accessible full-service grocery store. The question really came down to where it would be most suitable and where the most citizens would benefit.

                The City of Palm Springs is composed of dozens of departments and programs. Each department and program are somehow connected and affect one another. This can include project collaboration, permitting and enforcment, or a link within the same workflow chain. 
                The GIS Nexus (what I named it) is an internal application from the ESRI Enterprise application suite. This centeral page allows diffrent departments view information such as zoning, property information, fire hazard area, and dozens more department specfici layers. 
                This helps narrow the lag in communication between departments when figuring out if applicant for a building department falls within a historical district which would trigger a architectural review by the planning department.

              <p class="project-wrapper__text-info">
               The Palm Springs International Airport (PSP) is currently undergoing a technology change by switching from a legacy system to a cloud-based assest managment system.
               GIS is one of the core fundamentals of the assest managment program. PSP has never really used GIS or harnessed its technology to their advantage. At this time the 
               I have been tasked in coordinating the data collection efforts starting with the perimeter. Once the perimeter is collected the interior of the airport will be the 
               next step in data collection. One of the more difficult aspects of this project will be coordinating with the air traffic control tower when we would be able to collect 
               data on the actual runway. Communications of the status of this data collection between the Airport Director and GIS staff is important and it is why I created a dashboard
               to accomplish this.

              <p class="project-wrapper__text-info">
                On September 27th, 2020, the Glass Fire began burning in the area of Sonoma County and Napa County located in Northern California. Both counties
                were overwhelemed as they battled the Complex Fire which burned from August 16th, 2020 to November 12th, 2020. Staff resources were not only streched thin but
                staff were working continuously 24 hours. Napa County broadcasted a Emergency Managers Mutual-Aid (EMMA) request to the geographic area. Within minutes of
                recieving this request, I volunteered to provide relief to the GIS team. <p> My duties included creating evacuations maps, provide damage reports to staff, and update road closure and incident maps as needed. On October 20th, 2020, the Glass Fire was 100% contained and all efforts could now go towards the Complex Fire. 
                This was a very stressful situation for me, but a very rewarding feeling knowing that I able provided my services to the public and staff. I will certainly volunteer the next oportunity I get. </p>
